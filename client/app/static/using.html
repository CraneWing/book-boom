			<h2>Using This Site</h2>
		</div>	
			<p>This is a site for arranging book trades, most commonly between two people in the same geographical area, but also by distant traders who work through the mail.</p>
			
			<p>You've taken the first step by signing up for a BookBOOM account. Your starting point upon login is your <a href="#/dashboard">User Dashboard</a>. There you can view and update your profile and see the trades you've posted. You will also receive notification if anyone wants to trade with you, or if another trader you contacted wants to set up the trade.</p>
			
			<p>To add a trade, you have two options. The fastest is the <a href="#/search">book search page,</a> powered by Google Books and containing data on more than 25 million titles. Click on any book that comes up in the search results, and a trade is automatically created.</p>
			
			<p>The second way is to get the title to trade and <a href="#/trades/add">enter the data yourself</a>, including optionally uploading an image of the cover.</p>
			
			<p>To contact another trader, click on any book cover on the <a href="#/trades">All Trades</a> page. You'll be taken to that trade's individual page, where you can contact the trader with your interest in exchanging books.</p>
