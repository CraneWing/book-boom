# BookBOOM (A Book Trading Club App)

BookBOOM is the fourth of Free Code Camp's full-stack challenges. It is a trading club/app where users can contact each other to trade books. Authenticated users may browse books that others have posted, set up trades for these titles, and add their own trades.

These are the "user stories" this app must fulfill:

* I can view all books posted by every user.
* I can add a new book.
* I can update my settings to store my full name, city and state.
* I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.

App uses the MEAN (MongoDB-Express-Angular-Node) stock. Authentication is with the Angular module [Satellizer](https://github.com/sahat/satellizer) by Sahat Yakalbov.

A kind of retro Web. 1.0 look was deliberately used for the design because books, well, are as old school as you can get.
