# BookBOOM (A Book Trading Club App)

BookBOOM is the fourth of Free Code Camp's full-stack challenges. It is a book trading club/app where users can arrange trades. Authenticated users may browse books others have posted, set up trades and add trades of their own.

These are the "user stories" this app must fulfill:

* I can view all books posted by every user.
* I can add a new book.
* I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.
* I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.

App uses the MEAN (MongoDB-Express-Angular-Node) stock. Authentication is with the Angular module [Satellizer](https://github.com/sahat/satellizer) by Sahat Yakalbov.

A kind of retro Web. 1.0 look was deliberately used for the design because books, well, are as old school as you can get.
